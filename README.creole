= Sandbox: run Elisp in a jail =

Erbot runs the #emacs robot. He has a jail inside him for running
arbitary elisp safely. 

The code is here: git://git.sv.gnu.org/erbot.git

Also on GitHub [[https://github.com/sigma/erbot|here]].


== How to use it ==

First install sandbox and then:

{{{
(sandbox '(setq x 100))
}}}

//=>//

{{{
(emacs-sandbox-setq emacs-sandbox-x 100)
}}}

and:

{{{
(sandbox '(defun nic-test-2 () 100))
}}}

//=>//

{{{
(emacs-sandbox-defun emacs-sandbox-nic-test-2 nil 100)
}}}

== Gaps ==

We need a way to evaluate stuff coming out of the sandbox.

== Potential problems ==

bad fn calls?
infinite loops?
any other kind of DOS?
